# Home Assistant Test Suite

This test suite uses Selenium WebDriver and JavaScript to test the Home Assistant smart home application. It includes the following tests:

- **should open the Home Assistant login page:** navigates to the Home Assistant login page and asserts that the title and login form are present.
- **should log in to the Home Assistant dashboard:** logs in to the Home Assistant dashboard with a username and password, and asserts that the user is redirected to the dashboard.
- **should turn on a light in the Home Assistant dashboard:** navigates to the Home Assistant dashboard, clicks on a light switch, and asserts that the light is turned on.

Note that this test suite assumes that you have a local instance of Home Assistant running on `https://homeassistant.local:8123/` and that you have a username and password for logging in. You will need to modify the test suite to match your specific Home Assistant setup.
