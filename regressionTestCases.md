## Regression Tests

### Test Case 1: Should still display the correct state of a light after a refresh
1. Log in to the Home Assistant dashboard
2. Get the current state of a light
3. Refresh the page
4. Assert that the light is still in the same state as before the refresh

### Test Case 2: Should remember the last selected room after logging out and logging back in
1. Log in to the Home Assistant dashboard
2. Select a room
3. Log out of the dashboard
4. Log back in to the dashboard
5. Assert that the last selected room is still selected

### Test Case 3: Should still display the correct state of a device after a power outage
1. Log in to the Home Assistant dashboard
2. Get the current state of a device
3. Simulate a power outage by turning off the device's power source
4. Turn the device's power source back on
5. Assert that the device is in the same state as before the power outage

### Test Case 4: Should handle the addition and removal of devices without errors
1. Log in to the Home Assistant dashboard
2. Add a device to the dashboard
3. Verify that the device is added successfully
4. Remove the device from the dashboard
5. Verify that the device is removed successfully and that no errors occur

### Test Case 5: Should handle the addition and removal of users without errors
1. Log in to the Home Assistant dashboard
2. Add a user to the dashboard
3. Verify that the user is added successfully
4. Remove the user from the dashboard
5. Verify that the user is removed successfully and that no errors occur

Note that these tests are not exhaustive and additional regression tests may be required depending on the specific features and functionality of the Home Assistant instance being tested.
